# Littlest Dispatcher

An async-friendly, isomorphic [Flux][flux] library including implementations
of a Dispatcher, Actions, and Stores. _Part of the [Littlest][littlest] family._

## Philosophy

- Configuration over Convention
- Simple modules
- Small API surface area

## Features

- Serializable Stores
- Promise-based Actions (with automatic event dispatch)

## Usage

For an example app that doubles as a great starting point for Littlest Isomorph
projects, take a look at [the Yeoman Generator][generator].

## Alternatives

- [Dispatchr][dispatchr]: Another isomorphic dispatcher implementation by Yahoo.
